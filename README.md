**SQL Database Project for Employee Management**

This project is about building a relational database from the ground up, centered on handling employee-related data. It encompasses the phases of data modeling, engineering, and analysis to organize, fill, and interrogate a database that holds details on employees, their departments, salaries, and managerial connections.

**Project Structure**

*Data Modeling*

Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to illustrate the database structure and the connections between various tables.

*Data Engineering*

Created SQL schemas for six main tables: Employees, Departments, DepartmentEmployee, DepartmentManager, Salaries, and Titles.

Defined primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and other constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between tables.

Imported data from CSV files into the respective SQL tables, taking care to maintain the integrity of relationships through the correct import order.

**Data Analysis**

Performed various SQL queries to analyze the data, including:

Listing all employees with their details and salaries.

Identifying employees hired in a specific year.

Listing managers for each department.

Showcasing the department association for each employee.

Filtering employees by name criteria.

Enumerating employees within specific departments.

Counting the frequency of employee last names.

**Usage**

After setting up the database, you can run the analysis queries located in the queries directory to explore the employee data.

These queries cover a range of analyses, from basic listings of employee information to more complex aggregations.
