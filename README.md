**Challenge Overview**
This project is structured into three main sections: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. The objective is to model, engineer, and analyze data from provided CSV files to extract meaningful insights and information.

**Data Modeling**
*Objective:* Inspect the provided CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that illustrates the relationships between the tables.
Tools Suggested: You can use QuickDBD or any other ERD tool of your choice to create the sketch.
Data Engineering
Objective: Define and create the schema for each table based on the CSV files provided.

*Tasks*:
Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for each table.
Ensure primary keys are unique. If not, consider using a composite key to uniquely identify each row.
Create tables in an order that respects the dependencies imposed by foreign keys.
Import data from each CSV file into its corresponding table in the database.

**Data Analysis**
*Objective:* Execute SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database.
*Queries:*
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
